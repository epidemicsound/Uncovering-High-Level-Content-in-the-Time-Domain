Here's a basic outline of a torchaudio pipeline that can be used for online triplet mining:

Load the anchor audio file using torchaudio's load() function.
Check the file extension to determine the file format (e.g. mp3, wav, etc.). You can use Python's built-in os.path.splitext() function to extract the file extension from the file name.
Create a positive and negative audio by randomly selecting two other audio files from the same dataset as the anchor. These files should be different from the anchor and from each other. You can use PyTorch's DataLoader class to load a dataset and select the positive and negative samples.
To improve computational efficiency, you can set a maximum number of positives and negatives per anchor, and randomly select that many samples from the dataset for each anchor. You can also use PyTorch's DataLoader class to create batches of anchors, positives, and negatives.
Apply transforms, augmentations, and scrambles to the anchor, positives, and negatives using torchaudio's transforms module. You can create your own custom transforms by defining a Python function that takes an audio tensor as input and returns a transformed audio tensor.
Here's some sample code that demonstrates how to implement this pipeline:
'''

import os
import random
import torchaudio
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from dataset import MyDataset

# Define your custom transforms here
def custom_transform(audio):
    # apply your custom transformations here
    return audio

# Define your dataset here
dataset = MyDataset()

# Define your dataloader here
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Loop over each batch in the dataloader
for batch in dataloader:
    # Unpack the batch into anchors, positives, and negatives
    anchors, positives, negatives = batch

    # Loop over each anchor in the batch
    for i in range(len(anchors)):
        # Load the anchor audio
        anchor_audio, sample_rate = torchaudio.load(anchors[i])

        # Check the file extension
        extension = os.path.splitext(anchors[i])[1]
        if extension in ['mp3', 'wav', 'flac']:
            # Select a positive and negative audio
            positive_audio, _ = torchaudio.load(random.choice(positives))
            negative_audio, _ = torchaudio.load(random.choice(negatives))

            # Apply transforms to the anchor, positive, and negative audio
            anchor_audio = custom_transform(anchor_audio)
            positive_audio = custom_transform(positive_audio)
            negative_audio = custom_transform(negative_audio)

            # Use the transformed audio to train your model
            # ...

        else:
            # Skip files with unsupported extensions
            pass
